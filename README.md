Exploratory Data Analysis on Hospital "No-show" appointments

In this project I take a closer look at the dataset for a clinic, this data sets shows how people turn up for their appointments as at when scheduled. 
Despite the government effort to make health care easily accessible to everyone, why do some people still not show up for their scheduled appointment. 

I want to figure out 3 things so as to be able to make data-driven decisions, and the 3 questions I aim to answer are as follows

1. What percentage of patients that have appointments miss their appointments, 
 Of the percentage that misses appointments, what is the gender ratio in percentages and does gender play a role in why people miss their appointments.
2. The government gives some people free access to health care, in this study it's termed 'scholarship', i want to know if having a scholarship determines if a patient will show up for their appointment or not. 
3. And finally I want to know if a patient having a particular disease or ailment will affect their show up for the appointment.
